# Food-Traceability-System-using-Blockchain.

This software application is a small Java application named Food Supply Chain Tracker 
can be used for the demonstrating the concept of the traceability with trusted information in
the entire agri-food supply chain, which would effectively guarantee the food safety, by
gathering, transferring and sharing the authentic data of agri-food in production, processing,
warehousing, distribution and selling links.. 

Currently for demonstration purpose I have considered Supply Chain of Apple.

Note that, to view the demo you need to have an IDE installed (I have used NetBeans IDE )
with Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) also.
